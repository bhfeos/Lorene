 	      *	Lorene codes for rotating relativistic stars  *
	      *************************************************

1/ Description of the various codes
   ================================

nrotstar:	Code for a model of rigidly rotating star
nrotseq:	Code for a sequence of rigidly rotating stars


2/ Compilation
   ===========

Typing

	make all

will produce both executables in a non-optimized version for debugging purposes.  
To get optimized versions for production purposes type instead

	make -f Makefile_O2 nrotstar
or
	make -f Makefile_O2 nrotseq


You can clear everything by

	make uninstall


3/ Input parameters
   ================

The code nrotstar needs two input files:

par_rot.d :  parameters of the computation
par_eos.d : description of the equation of state

The code nrotseq needs two input files:

par_seq.d :  parameters of the computation
par_eos.d : description of the equation of state (same as nrotstar)

Templates files are provided in the directory Parameters ("GR" stands for general 
relativity and "Newt" for Newtonian gravitation). For instance
  (i) to get the model displayed in Figs. 3.1 to 3.7 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5015, do 
      cp Parameters/GR/APR_1.4Msol_716Hz/*.d .

  (ii)  to compute a relativistic polytropic (gamma=2) star rotating at the Keplerian limit, do
      cp Parameters/GR/Kepler/*.d .

  (iii) to compute a sequence of star models, do (you may change the EoS by using a different par_eos.d file than the one that is in that directory)
      cp Parameters/Sequence/*.d .
      

4/ Running
   =======

Simply type

	nrotstar
or
	nrotseq

Setting the parameter graph to 1 in the file par_rot.d/par_seq.d ensures that some graphical outputs are produced at the end of the computation. 
The main characteristics of the computed star are summarized in the file result.txt (human readable format). 
The full final configuration is saved in the file resu.d (binary format). 
The metric part of it is also saved in the file resu_gyoto.d (binary format) in a format readable by 
the ray-tracing code GYOTO. 
Some output files like convergence.d or prof_*.d can be visualized via xmgrace.
Profiles of various fields are in the files prof_X.d where X is the name of the field. 
The sequence main outputs are gievn in the file outseq.d
