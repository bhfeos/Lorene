Connection to the CVS repository in Meudon
------------------------------------------

        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@octane.obspm.fr:/cvsroot login
        password: anonymous


Downloading Lorene
------------------

	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@octane.obspm.fr:/cvsroot checkout Lorene

In each directory created under the directory Lorene, there is a subdirectory
CVS which contains the file Root with the line 
:pserver:anonymous@octane.obspm.fr:/cvsroot
This avoids to type the destination (option -d) each time you type a CVS
command. Also, the password is registred in the file .cvspass in your
home directory so that you don't need to type it again. 

Updating a directory
--------------------

	cd <directoty_name>
	cvs update

This will download from Lorene repository in Meudon any new version 
of files present in the directory and all subdirectories. 
But it will not download any new subdirectory. In order to have them,
you should type instead

	cvs update -d

It could be a good strategy to always use this last command.


Adding a new file
-----------------

To put in Lorene repository a file that you have created from scratch, 
type 
	cvs add <file_name>
	cvs commit


Committing your changes to the repository
-----------------------------------------

After having modified some files, you can send them to Lorene
repository by the command

	cvs commit -m "comment about what you have done..."

If you don't specify the -m option, cvs will prompt you with some 
editor (usually vi !, unless you setup the environment variable
$CVSEDITOR, i.e. add the line 

	setenv CVSEDITOR emacs

to your .tcshrc file). 

File status
-----------

You can get the list of files in your working directory
which are different with respect to those in the repository by the
command

	cvs -n -q update

To get the history of the successive versions of a given file, type

	cvs log <file_name>
