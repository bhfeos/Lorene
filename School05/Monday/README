 * This directory contains simple C++ classes, which are not part of
 * the main LORENE library.
 *
 * These classes are intended to illustrate polynomial 
 * approximation to functions (mainly interpolation on various
 * grids). There are two families of classes:
 *  -- Grid : grids as sampling of [-1,1], declared in the file grid.h
 *  -- Ortho_poly : orthogonal polynomials, declared in the file 
 *          ortho_poly.h 
 *
 * There are also some simple graphical routines (declared in the file
 *  plot.h), which provides provides an interface to PGPLOT, in order
 * to perform easily some drawings (X11, EPS or PNG). 
 *
 * The main codes are
 *  -- es.C : test code for class Grid
 *  -- runge.C : exhibition of Runge's phenomenon
 *  -- cheby.C : Chebyshev expansions
 *  -- legendre.C : Legendre expansions
 *  -- interpole.C : comparison of various interpolations of a function
 *  -- approx_ortho.C : approximation of a function by orthogonal 
 *                          polynomials
