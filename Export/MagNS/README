1/ Description of the various codes
   ================================

read_mag_ns: code for reading a binary file containing data from a spectral computation
             of a rotating magnetized neutron stars with Lorene and exporting
             all the fields on a Cartesian grid.

2/ Documentation
   =============

   No documentation for the moment... sorry!

3/ Compilation
   ===========

Typing

	gmake

will produce the executable read_mag_ns in a non-optimized version for
debugging purposes. To get an optimized version for production purposes
type instead

	gmake -f Makefile_O2

You can clear everything by

	gmake uninstall


4/ Input parameters
   ================

The code read_mag_ns needs one input file:

read_mag_ns.par :  parameters of the Cartesian grid and name of the spectral data file

The spectral data files resulting from Lorene computations can be obtained by
running the code magstar in Lorene/Codes/Magstar
After running magstar, copy the file resu.d to this directory and specify its
name in read_mag_ns.par (test_data.d by default).

5/ Running
   =======

Simply type

	read_mag_ns

The output files are:

        inib.d : data on the Cartesian grid in a binary format; can be used as input in
                 the constructor Mag_NS::Mag_NS(FILE* ) for further processing

        inif.d : data on the Cartesian grid in a formatted format; can be used as input in
                 the constructor Mag_NS::Mag_NS(ifstream& ) for further processing
